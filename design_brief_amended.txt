{designer} & <coder>

Hello, I'm a freelance coder and designer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm a Creative turned Programmer. My versatile background includes graphic design, animation, and coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Frontend design with the power of coding tools is my specialty. I value smart design and digital analytics, and above all else, transparency. Do you want actionable advice on digital strategy and design?

2. COLOR CHOICES

BACKGROUND COLOR
Light Gray | #ebecf4
This shade of gray draws the eye to the right place, the images and text

HEADER
Light Gray | #dcfaed
This simple shade of gray helps to bring attention to the logo & navigation menu
________________________

COVER BODY
Light Gray | #ebecf4
Similar to the background the body color serves as a container to draw the readers attention to the text and images.
________________________

FOOTER
White | #f7f7f7
The intention of this off-with color is to make the footer easy to read
________________________

TEXT
Dark Gray | #626262
Eye-popping dark gray text is used in order to keep the reader reading, It reminds me of black text but a little more calmer.
________________________

LINK
Main |  Dark Purple | #5c5fc8
The metaphor for this light green is a green light on stop sign. It says, "GO" or click this link to the next page
________________________

Hover | Light Green | #97dec8
The vibrancy of this purple is creative and unusual, it sparks curiosity for the user to keep surfing through other parts of the site.
